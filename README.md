<h1 align = "center">Four Bit ALU</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Four-Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations on four-bit binary numbers. 
  This ALU is designed for processing data in a four-bit format, making it suitable for various applications in digital systems.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
